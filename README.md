# India Police Hackathon - Solution from Team Initiable

Indian police take a lot of effort in maintaining the security and integrity of the society. They are still using ledgers to maintain their monitoring of the areas (Beat Areas). It is necessary for them to use technology which is advanced and feasible. The earlier technology which was being used had hardware components such as tags placed in public. They were destroyed or were difficult to maintain. We propose a completely end-to-end software-based Beat Resource Management System. This will reduce the time taken by the police to monitor activities and will improve their productivity.

We will be building one mobile application and one web application. The mobile application is for the police who will go on "Beats". They will go to their assigned Beat place and will check-in using the same app. The web app will provide a monitoring system for the police, will use machine learning to provide an automated beat allocation system. Also will provide interactive analysis and visualisation. The mobile app will be a React Native based and the web app will be Node.js, React.js based. The application will be powered by Google Cloud Platform for continuous deployment and continuous delivery.

# Solution

An end to end SaaS police Beat Management System for the Karnataka State Police Department. The police will go on "Beats" which are essentially patrolling tasks assigned to each cop or a group of cops for a particular area. Our solution will have a mobile application which will be used by these beat cops for logging their day-to-day activities. The web application will be a monitoring system for the data sent by the mobile application. The web application will also offer analytics, AI powered beat allocation system, secure data management and role based authorization.
